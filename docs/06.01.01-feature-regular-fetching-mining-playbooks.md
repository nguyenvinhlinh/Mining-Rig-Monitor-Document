# Feature 1: Fetching newer mining playbooks regularly

## I. What is a minining playbooks
A term `playbook`, I takes it from `ansible`, `ansible playbook`. It indicates how a computer should mine a crypto currency.
A mining playbook include but not limited to:

- A miner software
- Its version
- argument list passing to the miner software
    - address
    - worker name
    - pool

    S->>C: my playbook stash is empty, this is my API_CODE, please give me mining playbooks!
    C-->>S: this is your mining playbooks
    S-->>S: Store new playbooks into a MiningPlaybookStash(GenServer), marked `new`

    Note right of S: After 5 seconds
    S->>C: My latest update_at is T, and this is my API_CODE, please give me new mining playbooks!

    alt there is new playbooks
