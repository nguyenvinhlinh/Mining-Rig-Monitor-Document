# Feature 1: Turn On/Off ASIC Miner
This is a core feature of **Remote Relay Controller (RRC)** which helps remotely turn on/off ASIC Miner from **Mining Rig Monitor/Commander**.

Given that:
- RRC did connect to wifi and have wifi connection
- RRC know IP address of ASIC Sentry
- RRC expose RRC_CODE, RRC_CODE is used to identify RRC.

A flow is simple:

- On the **Commander**, user will set `expected_status` of **asic miner**.
- **ASIC Sentry** will do regular HTTP GET for this data `expected_status` from **Commander** (every 5 seconds). Keep in mind that **one ASIC Sentry** can controll **many ASIC**
- **ASIC Sentry** find a way to reduce heat on hashboard (by enter incorrect mining pool maybe) and power consumption. (this is phrase 2, it's hard!)
- **Remote Relay Controller(RRC)** will do regular HTTP GET for `expected_status` from **ASIC Sentry** (every 5 seconds). Keep in mind that **one RRC** controll **one and only one ASIC**. Finally, it `shutdown` or `turn on` **ASIC**

## 1. Sequence Diagram

    User ->> Commander: (1) Set expected status of ASIC
    Commander -->> User: (2) OK
    ASIC Sentry ->> Commander: (3) Fetch expected status for a list of ASIC
    Commander -->> ASIC Sentry: (4) Return a list of expected status
    RRC ->> ASIC Sentry: (5) get expected status
    ASIC Sentry -->> RRC: (6) return expected status
    alt asic_expected_status equals asic_current_status
        RRC->>RRC: Do nothing
    else is not equal
        RRC->>RRC: turn on/off as asic_expected_status
        RRC->>RRC: update asic_current_status
    end

```
