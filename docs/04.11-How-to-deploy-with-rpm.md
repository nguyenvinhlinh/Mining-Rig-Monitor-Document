## [1] RPM Install

Go to [https://github.com/nguyenvinhlinh/Mining-Rig-Monitor/releases/tag/v1.0.0](https://github.com/nguyenvinhlinh/Mining-Rig-Monitor/releases/tag/v1.0.0) and download `mining-rig-monitor-1.0.0-1.fc40.x86_64.rpm`.

```sh
cd ~/Downloads/
wget https://github.com/nguyenvinhlinh/Mining-Rig-Monitor/releases/download/v1.0.0/mining-rig-monitor-1.0.0-1.fc40.x86_64.rpm

Complete!

```

Check `/opt/mining_rig_monitor` for more details. Running `dnf install` do copy files to `/opt/mining_rig_monitor`.

## [2] Test run with script before working with systemd service.

```sh
export SECRET_KEY_BASE=Mc5oIum6N8aeNdjghwfJQYVE2OQncnqBkCCyaXdA1X/puugR99VvcSuvAqOoGYdW
export DATABASE_URL=ecto://USER:PASS@HOST/database
export PORT=4000
export PHX_HOST=127.0.0.1

# To migrate db
/opt/mining_rig_monitor/bin/migrate

# To start server
/opt/mining_rig_monitor/bin/server

# To stop server
/opt/mining_rig_monitor/bin/mining_rig_monitor stop
```

## [3] Create systemd service /etc/systemd/system/mining_rig_monitor.service

```
[Unit]
Description=Mining Rig Monitor
After=network.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/opt/mining_rig_monitor
EnvironmentFile=/etc/mining_rig_monitor/mining_rig_monitor.env
ExecStart=/opt/mining_rig_monitor/bin/server
ExecStop=/opt/mining_rig_monitor/bin/mining_rig_monitor stop
User=nguyenvinhlinh
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## [4] Create environment file `/etc/mining_rig_monitor/mining_rig_monitor.env`
```text
SECRET_KEY_BASE=
DATABASE_URL=ecto://USER:PASS@HOST/database
PORT=4000
PHX_HOST=127.0.0.1
```

Regarding `PHX_HOST`, modify it to match domain/ip which web browser calling. if not, there will be an error.

```text
[error] Could not check origin for Phoenix.Socket transport.
Origin of the request: http://192.168.1.9:4000
This happens when you are attempting a socket connection to
a different host than the one configured in your config/
files. For example, in development the host is configured
to "localhost" but you may be trying to access it from
"127.0.0.1". To fix this issue, you may either:
  1. update [url: [host: ...]] to your actual host in the
     config file for your current environment (recommended)
  2. pass the :check_origin option when configuring your
     endpoint or when configuring the transport in your
     UserSocket module, explicitly outlining which origins
     are allowed:
        check_origin: ["https://example.com",
                       "//another.com:888", "//other.com"]
```

and Run `systemctl daemon-reload`

## [5] Start systemd service named `mining_rig_monitor`
```shell
systemctl enable --now mining_rig_monitor
```

## [6] To view log
```shell
➜ ~ journalctl -f -u mining_rig_monitor.service
server[1361153]: 00:31:18.061 [info] [AsicMinerOperationalIndex][broadcast_operational_data] Starting.

## [7] How to migrate database while deploy with RPM?
To migrate database, you need to run `/opt/mining_rig_monitor/bin/migrate`. But keep in mind that, you will need
- SECRET_KEY_BASE
- DATABASE_URL

These two variables can be found in `/etc/mining_rig_monitor/mining_rig_monitor.env` (see step [3]).

```
export SECRET_KEY_BASE=XXX
export DATABASE_URL=XXX
/opt/mining_rig_monitor/bin/migrate
```
